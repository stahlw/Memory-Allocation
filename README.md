# Memory-Allocation
Recreate malloc from C and runtests that show allocating and freeing of memory chunks. To run, make sure to invoke the mallok_test.c file along with mallok.h to run the test program that allocates 1000 bytes of data at a time for testing, followed by freeing said bytes for later use.
